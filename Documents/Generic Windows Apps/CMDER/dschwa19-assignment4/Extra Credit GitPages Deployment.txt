In order to launch my angular app on the above url I had to install
npm git pages through the command line.
Then i had to use a -prod command to "put the app in production"?
Afterward I got an error saying it didn't like my file structure,
so I had to move files around until it was happy and stopped complaining
to me. I also had to specify where the origin was and it was the url
for the website I chose. I also cloned my repository for my working 
project to not mess that up further than I already have.
